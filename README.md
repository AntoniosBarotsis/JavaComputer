# JavaComputer

## A computer in java (duh)

## Features as of now:
 *Fully functional CPU with memory\
 *Fully function Instructionset, containing Moving, arithmetics, logical, branching, stack manipulation, and function call instructions\
 *Preserves registers by itself on the stack when calling subroutines, so no need to preserve them yourself
## Coming soon:
Own assembler!\
Memory mapped IO!
# Instalation:
(not tested, so if this doesn't work shoot me a message)
1. Create a new project in IntelliJ
2. Create 4 new files, named according to the files in this git repository
3. Copy-paste the content into the files
4. Run the project, with the CPU's main class being the main function\

You can make your own 'Program' by modifying the bytecode being written in main.
## Some other info
I made this in the freshmen discord server, along with some other people in a call. We spent 6 hours total on this as of now, consisting of a 2 hour chunk (before a lecture) and another 4 hour chunk (after that lecture).\
Both sittings were recorded and uploaded to youtube, so to see us messing around in java and building it from scratch, you can visit these links: https://youtu.be/PAJS4On2_fg and https://youtu.be/-G-1VTyQ5A8 \
\
As for now, we've also made and tested some code in it, for example a power function, which worked flawlessly.
